<p>CSS Selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in an HTML document. This is <strong>super</strong> useful.</p>
<p>Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select arbritrary boxes in your web pages.</p>
<p>Once you successfully develop a set of selectors and CSS rules, it's relatively easily to match a document with those rules.</p>
